# Sample Sound Files

This directory contains placeholder files for the default sounds. 

To use the extension properly, you should:

1. **Add real sound files** in these supported formats:
   - `.wav` (recommended)
   - `.mp3`
   - `.ogg`
   - `.m4a`

2. **Name them as follows**:
   - `save.wav` - File save notification
   - `error.wav` - Error alert
   - `warning.wav` - Warning notification
   - `completion.wav` - Code completion
   - `build_success.wav` - Successful build
   - `build_failure.wav` - Failed build

3. **Where to get sounds**:
   - [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org) - Free sound effects
   - [Zapsplat](https://zapsplat.com) - Professional sounds (free registration)
   - [Notification Sounds](https://notificationsounds.com) - Simple notifications

4. **Sound recommendations**:
   - Keep sounds under 2 seconds
   - Use consistent volume levels
   - Choose pleasant, non-intrusive tones

## Current Status

The extension will work without these files by falling back to alternative audio methods, but having proper sound files will provide the best experience.

To test if sounds are working, use the command:
`Sound Notification: Play Test Sound` from the Command Palette.
